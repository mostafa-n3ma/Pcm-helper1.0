# PCM App Description:
### About:
**Welcome**
I am Mostafa Nema and this is the PCM assistant Application
I work as a technical examiner in the surface engineering department of Al-Waha Oil Company, which operates the Al-Ahdab oil field / Wasit / Iraq
I work in the PCM team to check the external corrosion of oil pipes
I did this work to reduce the effort and save time in making long reports and to ensure more quality and accuracy to save information.

The work of the PCM has always been tiring and exhausting, as we work in various parts of the field and travel long distances on foot daily to check the oil lines accurately and look for potential corrosion points, as an average of  150 kilometers  of pipelines are checked annually 
However, we return to the office or home, as in the past year, to work on writing reports and saving the information that was recorded on the same day

**In normal work:**
- Points are recorded in the word.docx file as an average of 30 points.
- Then it is converted to an excel file. to apply specific equations and calibrate the GPS coordinates to match the maps we work with.
- Then this coordinate is converted to a DWG map on AutoCAD to be projected and the path is drawn with the points specified on it.
      It is sometimes annoying and difficult and requires a lot of scrutiny to maintain accuracy because it is very important

<<**So the reason for this application is to facilitate the task of preparation and help save a lot of time**>>

**Where the application does the following:**
- Full oil line data registration and points registration and saving them to a local database.
- Taking GPS coordinates of the site with a high accuracy of up to 2 meters.
- Exporting the information in the form of a ready-made excel file containing the information and data of the oil line with a table of points and their information and coordinates for each point and they have been calibrated to match the AutoCAD maps.

All you have to do is record the information, then save it in the application and export it to an excel file. You can copy the coordinates and drop them directly on the map to draw the path.


**Average time taken to record data:>>**
(30 points)
- normal work  30 minutes .
- In the application  10 minutes.

**Average time to write single point:>>**
- Recording it on the regular worksheet and using the GPS device <b>5 minutes</b> GPS accuracy 5 meters.
- Recording it in the application and taking the coordinates through the application <b>1 minute</b>  GPS accuracy 2 meters.


**Average time taken to write the report:>>**
(30 points)
- normal work  1 hour.
- In the application  2 minutes.
